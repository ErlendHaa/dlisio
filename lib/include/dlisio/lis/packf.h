/*
 * Parse and pack arbitrary data
 *
 * The lis_packf (inspired by sscanf) reads arbitrary bytes in RP66 format,
 * and pack them into the dst area as native C data. No padding bytes are
 * inserted, which means the data can be read from this array by computing the
 * correct offset and memcpy'd into a typed variable.
 *
 * fmt is a sscanf-inspired format string of conversion specifiers (LIS_FMT_*).
 * The size of each type depends on the most natural corresponding C type, e.g.
 * I8 is int8_t, and F32 is float. The arguments to a lis_type() function in
 * lisio/types.h is the type being used as a target type for a conversion
 * specifier.
 *
 * String types are always written as int32_t + len bytes, without a zero
 * terminator.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Extracting a frame with three channels:
 * C1 -> 1x1 i16     (int32_t)
 * C2 -> 2x1 f32     (float)
 * C3 -> 1x1 byte    (uint8_t)
 *
 * int32_t C1;
 * float   C2[2];
 * uint8_t C3;
 *
 * unsigned char bytes[2 + 2*4 + 4];
 * err = lis_packf("iffb", src, bytes);
 * if (err) exit(1);
 *
 * memcpy(&C1, bytes,      sizeof(C1));
 * memcpy(C2,  bytes + 2,  sizeof(C2));
 * memcpy(&c3, bytes + 10, sizeof(C3));

/*
 * Check if a format string for packing is var-size or fixed-size
 *
 * This function is intended for checking if format strings built from
 * inspecting records is fixed-sized or not, which in turn can guide if it's
 * possible to random-access onto variables. The output variables are booleans
 * - the src output is true if the format is variable-size on disk, and the dst
 * output is true if the format is variable-size *in memory*. This is
 * determined by the presence of UVARI and ORIGIN which are variable-sized on
 * disk, but fixed-size in memory.
 *
 * This functionality can be implemented by manually checking if the format
 * string contains any of "sSoOAQ", but is provided for convenience.
 *
 * Returns LIS_OK on success, and LIS_INVALID_ARGS if the format strings
 * contain any invalid format specifier. The output params are non-zero if
 * there are any variable-length values in the format specifier, and 0 if all
 * types are fixed-length. If the function fails, the output variable is
 * untouched.
 *
 * To compute the length of a fixed-size string, use lis_pack_size. src is the
 * size of the pack on disk, and dst the length of the packed string in memory,
 * i.e.  UVARI is 4 bytes, not inconsistent. For individual object sizes, refer
 * to the LIS_SIZEOF constants in lisio/primitives.h
 *
 * NOTE:
 * lis_pack_size considers the src variable-size when fmt has UVARI, but the
 * dst fixed-size. This will return LIS_OK, but set src to
 * LIS_VARIABLE_LENGTH (= 0).
 *
 * For both functions, both src and dst can be NULL, in which case no data will
 * be written.
