def load(path):
    """ Loads and indexes a file

    A LIS file are typically segmented into multiple Logical Files (LF). LF's
    are just a way to group information that logically belongs together. LF's
    are completely independent of each other and can generally be treated as if
    they where different files on disk. In fact - that's just what load does.
    Each logical file gets it's own io-device and is completely segmented from
    other LF's.

    Notes
    -----

    It's not uncommon that LIS files are stored with different file extensions
    than `.LIS`. For example `.LTI` or `.TIF`. Load does not care about file
    extension at all. As long as the content adheres to the Log Interchange
    Standard, load will read it as such.

    Parameters
    ----------

    path : str_like
        path to lis-file

    Returns
